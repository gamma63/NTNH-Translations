betterquesting.quest.NPMNrp3qTRGLJwRAJlQT4g.desc=The firebox and the heating oven are machines capable of producing heat (TU) from solid fuels for any machines that require heat to operate.%n%nBoth machines are similar in operation. In order for them to transfer heat, another machine for receiving the heat must be placed on top, such that the copper heat plate on the receiving machine sits on top of the copper heat plate of the heat producing machine.%n%nOnce constructed, these machines can be filled with solid fuel, which will burn until either the fuel runs out, or the heat buffer is filled. No fuel will be consumed if its buffer is full — as such, both machines are fairly efficient at conserving fuel.%n%nThe primary difference in these two machines lie in their speed\: the firebox burns fuel much slower at full efficiency, whilst the heating oven produces five time the heat (but eight times faster). Despite its inefficiency, the heating oven is often preferred for its much higher heat outputs and heat capacity. However, it cannot heat a stirling engine, as its base output (500 TU/t) will automatically over-speed the engine; the heavy stirling engine does not have this issue.%n%nAdditionally, the heating oven can receive heat from other heat producing machines placed underneath it\: multiple can be stacked for heat-hungry machines like the crucible. The heat received, however, is halved when transferring to the machine above.

# Quest: Stirling Engine
betterquesting.quest.NnSRHrsfSLuMw0e0H3InYQ.name=Stirling Engine
betterquesting.quest.NnSRHrsfSLuMw0e0H3InYQ.desc=The Stirling Engine uses heat from a Heating Oven or a Firebox to produce power.

# Quest: Spatial IO
betterquesting.quest.9GDCKm30REKhSI8XYqhWOg.name=Spatial IO
betterquesting.quest.9GDCKm30REKhSI8XYqhWOg.desc=Spatial IO is a way to cut-and-paste physical volumes of space in your world. It works by swapping the defined volume with an identically-sized volume in the spatial storage dimension, sending whatever's in the pylon array to the spatial storage dimension, and whatever's in the dimension to the pylon array.%n%nSpatial IO requires a specific arrangement of its components in order to function, and define the volume to be cut-and-pasted. All of the components must be on the same network in order to function, and you can have only one spatial IO setup on a network. Thus, a subnetwork is recommended.%n%nThe Spatial IO Port controls the spatial IO operation. It shows stats on the multiblock setup, and holds the spatial cells%n%nTo perform a spatial IO operation, place a spatial storage cell in the input slot and give the spatial IO port a redstone pulse. It will then swap the volume in the pylons with the volume in the spatial storage dimension. This means that if you send some set of blocks to the spatial storage dimension, then put another set of blocks in the pylons, put the cell back in the input slot, and trigger the IO port again, the 2nd set of blocks will disappear and the 1st set of blcks will reappear.%n%nAny entity in the defined volume, including you, will be carried along, and if you have no way of getting out, you will be trapped in the spatial storage dimension.%n%nSpatial Pylons are the main part of a spatial IO setup, and define the volume to be affected. The volume is defined by the bounding box of the outside of the pylons, contracted in by 1 block in all directions.

Created by crafting 8 ME Quantum Ring and a ME Quantum Link Chamber and placing the ME Quantum Link Chamber in the center, and sourrounding it in the 8 ME Quantum Ring.%n%nEach Quantum Network Bridge requires power to function. This power must be provided from the network fragment it is attached to until the bridge is linked; at which time power from either side will be available. However if power is lost, connectivity will fail and power will be drained from the side the bridge is on in attempt to restore connection.%n%nTo establish a link between 2 Quantum Network Bridges, you must create a pair of Quantum Entangled Singularities. One of each will be placed inside of a particular connection. Each Bridge may only connect to one other bridge.%n%nAE2 Singularities are created by dumping 256k of any block inside a Matter Condenser. Singularities can become Quantum Entangled by dropping a Singularity and Ender dust and then exploding them together.

betterquesting.quest.TE4kReIyRvCVNfRpdb1DQg.name=Dyson Anatmogenesis Terraformer
betterquesting.quest.TE4kReIyRvCVNfRpdb1DQg.desc=Like the previous two, the terraformer is one of the consumers of the swarm's energy. Similar to the atmosphere editor, the terraformer can release and absorb gases to alter their composition. By default, it will release oxygen into the atmosphere, making it breathable. The fluid identifier is used to switch between gas types, and the screwdriver toggles between releasing and absorbing gases from the atmosphere. Consumption is 150 TE/s (i.e., a minimum of about 1024 Dyson swarm units is required).%n%nPosition it so that the square window receives the beam. When the terraformer is operating, the copper coils will start to twitch and shake slightly, and clouds of gas will be abundantly released from the center (the color will match the color of the air).

betterquesting.quest.XbTJRWJNTKa4UEeLPV0urg.desc=Well, you've completed the space stage of the game; now the entire space knows and fears you (you are a true space pirate). Here are a couple more nuances about the Dyson swarm\:%n%nDo not place converters directly next to the receiver - this will cause a malfunction.%n%nMultiple players in the same game world can create multiple swarms, but keep in mind that different swarms reduce each other's efficiency. This can encourage players to either work together on one common swarm or compete to extract more energy from their own swarm.

# Quest: Balls-O-Tron
betterquesting.quest.ZeBLQUsPS72HAxsrR9s_3g.name=Balls-O-Tron
betterquesting.quest.ZeBLQUsPS72HAxsrR9s_3g.desc=Balls-O-Tron is the second boss of NTM. It can be summoned by interracting the Mechanist's circle, found in the Enargite Temple which spawns in jungles, with a Silver Key, made using the Maskman Coin.

# Quest: Dyson Reciever
betterquesting.quest.gvtVSZCYTsmh3w4snviJhQ.name=Dyson Reciever
betterquesting.quest.gvtVSZCYTsmh3w4snviJhQ.desc=This mechanism receives energy from the Dyson swarm and converts it into a beam. It requires a satellite ID chip with a specific frequency to operate. Note that by default, the receiver only receives energy during daylight hours, not at night or in the rain\! (We'll talk about night mode later). Also, remember that operation will cease if sunlight is blocked by blocks or other mechanisms. This beam can be converted into various forms of energy using the mechanisms described below. Be careful\: the beam explodes blocks and entities that fall into the affected area\!%n%nWhen hovering the cursor, it displays the number of Dyson swarm modules and consumers of its energy. There can be multiple receivers, and the output energy will be divided equally among all devices.

# Quest: Dyson Energy and Heat Converters
betterquesting.quest.kDJNky14Tf6N88VaRNRUJQ.name=Dyson Energy and Heat Converters
betterquesting.quest.kDJNky14Tf6N88VaRNRUJQ.desc=If you want to use energy from the swarm in the form of electricity, you'll need this mechanism. Install it so that the beam from the receiver hits the dark square window on the end. If done correctly, a working animation will appear (transformers at the back will spark). To take the energy, there is a port at the back.%n%nIf you need to convert the beam into heat, there is another mechanism - a heater powered by the Dyson swarm. It should be used in the same way. There is a copper contact on top for heat consumers.

# Quest: My First Volcano!
betterquesting.quest.vTg3C5JATXuER43bG5IiiQ.name=My First Volcano\!
betterquesting.quest.vTg3C5JATXuER43bG5IiiQ.desc=The formation of a volcano is driven by the volcanic core, a block that continuously erupts lava, allowing the volcano to grow. The lava cools quickly, turning into basalt or basaltic ore.%n%nThe resulting volcano grows quite slowly, reaching about 60 blocks in height over 20-30 minutes.%nVolcanic lava differs from regular lava not only in appearance. It "melts" any non-explosion-resistant blocks, so the volcano can extend underground.%nBasaltic ores (asbestos, sulfur, fluorite, molysite) form when the lava cools, each with a 0.5%% chance.%n%nVolcanic gem ore spawns with a 5%% chance if the following conditions are met\:%n- All 6 blocks around the cooling lava are basalt or lava;%n- The block 10 blocks above the cooling lava is basalt or lava;%n- There are fewer than 3 lava blocks around the cooling lava.%nThe ore also forms after volcanic lava contacts diamond ore.%nThis means volcanic gems most often appear near the core or crater of the volcano.%n%n[note]Forming a Radioactive Volcano%nIf the volcanic core is exposed to radioactive fallout (e.g., after a nearby nuclear explosion) for some time, the core will begin generating new volcanic radioactive lava (yellow in color), ultimately leading to the formation of a so-called radioactive volcano. Such a volcano will consist not of basalt but of various types of quenched sellaphite blocks and sellaphite ores. The lava will convert diamond ores into radioactive gem ore.[/note]
